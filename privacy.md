# Privacy Policy for Global Unblocking

_Last updated: 14/5/25_

Global Unblocking is a Discord bot that mirrors messages across a shared global chat channel. We value your privacy and are committed to minimizing data collection.

## Data Collection

We **do not** collect or store any user data such as messages, usernames, or IDs as part of the botâ€™s core functionality.

When the bot encounters an error, it may generate a temporary log for debugging purposes. These logs:
- May contain user IDs or partial message content.
- Are **not stored**, saved, or shared.
- Are only visible to the developer during active debugging.

## Third-Party Sharing

We do **not** share any data with third parties.

## Data Retention

We do **not** retain any data. Temporary logs are discarded immediately after an issue is resolved or the session ends.

## User Rights

Because we do not store personal data, there is nothing to request for access or deletion.

## Contact

For privacy-related questions or concerns, please contact:

- Email: privacy@unblocker.chat

## Open Source

This bot is not currently open source. If that changes, this policy will be updated with a link to the public repository.
